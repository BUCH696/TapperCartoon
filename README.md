This is my first adequate cross-platform game. Terrible project structure, terrible code, everything is terrible.. 
But I appreciate it for the fact that this is my first project in Unity and, as for me, not so bad in appearance. 
I'll leave a video of the Gameplay, if you like it, I can make a WEB version or finish it to the end!
