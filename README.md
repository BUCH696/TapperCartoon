This is my first adequate cross-platform game. Terrible project structure, terrible code, everything is terrible.. 
But I appreciate it for the fact that this is my first project in Unity and, as for me, not so bad in appearance. 
I'll leave a video of the Gameplay, if you like it, I can make a WEB version or finish it to the end!

## Management
**W,A,S,D** - movement

**E** - take the beer from the barrel/ put the bottle on the table

**B** - buff on Super Beer. Yes, yes, Super beer)
